**Welcome to the handbook of the Open Science Community Torino!**

The handbook is the public place for OSCT members and the public to create traning materials, guides and other content for everyone to use on Open Science and its application in practice.
Anyone can contribute to the handbook: it is hosted on GitHub ([OSCTorino/handbook](https://github.com/OSCTorino/handbook)) and licensed under **TODO**.

It is not a book to be read top-to-bottom, but a reference to be used when needed.

It is divided in sections:
- The [Data Management](/data_management/) section deals with handling data produced by your laboratory in a clear and rational way, also keeping in mind data sharing aspects.
  This section also includes information on data management plans, storage solutions, FAIR data, and much more. This section also discusses the reproducibility and transparency of data analysis methods and experimental protocols alike, convering topics like Containerization, reporting of results, accessibility of analysis code, licensing, collaboration and more.
- The [Open Science](/open_science/) section covers all other aspects of Open Science: its history, scholarly publishing, Open Access, Citizen science, academic evaluation, and collaboration tools and platforms that enable Open Science in practice.
- The [Meta](/meta/) section covers practical how-tos regarding the open science community itself: how to join, how to participate in the creation of events, how to edit this handbook and more.
